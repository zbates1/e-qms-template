So this is more of a notetaking for claude. From what I have learned about DoE and QbD, it more a methodology of approaching certain engineering approaches, and particularly within a DHF it is baked into the process of Design Controls, inputs and such. So there aren't too many files I would need to account for this. 

Also I am starting to get a sense for what processes will take place. Lets say you discover a new risk, and then you update RMF. From here you could either update design inputs and then follow the rest of the DHF through verfication, validation, and design transfer, OR you could try to design new verification protocols to account for this new risk. However, if you change design inputs, you generally will need to go all the way through design transfer. 

Also, I would like you to list all of the ISO compliance I have, I know you specified ISO 13845, and I would also like to adhere to ISO 14971 with pre mortem logs. But I don't know where these should go. Another LLM said I should use them in my ELN. 

Also, I would like you to incorporate Mkdocs and Sphinx to create dev and user documentation. I am not sure how I want to do this so please help me brainstorm. 

Sphinx repo (/docs/dev/) for deep technical & API docs that benefit from cross-refs and autodoc.

MkDocs site (/docs/user/) for tutorials, protocols, and lab notebooks that need quick Markdown editing and a polished front end.

Process habits that keep docs alive
Habit	Why it works
(least important, can't implement rule in github) “Docs-or-it-didn’t-happen” rule—every merged PR must touch /docs or /dhf.	Prevents stale docs.
Docathon Friday—reserve last hour of the week for documentation chores.	Socializes responsibility.
Pre-mortem logs—before a risky experiment, write a short hypothesis & risks section in the ELN; link it in the PR.	Builds a risk file for ISO 14971.
A CI job can sweep the repo for premortem.md files, copy them into /risk/ and append them to the formal Risk Management File during release tagging. (That automated copy is what “builds a risk file for ISO 14971.”) 
Run Sphinx‐linkcheck + MkDocs spell-check in CI.	Catches broken links & typos early.
Automate changelogs and DHF index with git log → towncrier or custom script.	Keeps traceability effortless.
Link & spell checks	sphinx-build -b linkcheck + mkdocs-spellcheck in CI
Changelog & DHF index	towncrier + small Git-log script during release

Sphinx resource (Drop-in snippets for step-by-step experimental protocols, hazard tables, etc.; all CSS is already responsive & print-safe.)
MkDocs resource (Each template ships pre-wired admonition “call-outs” like
!!! note "Reagents" or !!! warning "PPE" so you can render coloured boxes for reagent lists, equipment check-lists, safety notes with a single line of Markdown.)

Front‑matter for every controlled Markdown file

Start every sprint with a draft PRD in /02_DesignInputs/.

For any risky experiment create premortem.md inside the ELN folder; reference it in the pull request. A nightly script copies it to /RMF/premortems/ so your RMF grows automatically.

Towncrier assembles release notes; CI zips /DHF + /RMF + /QMS/Registers into released/DHF_rev*.zip.

Stage‑1 Mock Audit right after first verification run; fix gaps before the official auditor.

Notebook summary: at the end of each ELN folder, write DV_Report.md using the five‑block template:


I will also need you to help me create extensive documentation for kickstarting new prototyping, creating revisions, drawing conclusions from experiments, etc. Here is example from other LLM:

5. Records cheat‑sheet
Record	What it is	Where it lives (in tree)
DHF – Design History File	Everything that proves you followed design control	/DHF/
DMR – Device Master Record	All specs needed to build the final product (drawings, BOMs, software binaries, assembly SOPs)	/DHF/07_DesignTransfer/DMR_index.md + linked files
RMF – Risk Management File	Hazard log, FMEAs, risk/benefit analysis	/RMF/ (mirrored snapshots also copied to /DHF/04_RiskManagement/ at reviews)
DHR – Device History Record	Trace of each individual unit built & tested (production lot records)	Usually lives in the factory MES/QMS, not in the R&D repo. Add as needed when you hit pilot builds.

Bottom line: DHF ≠ QMS. The QMS SOPs define how you create a DHF; the DHF is the per‑product proof you followed those SOPs. The DMR is the “recipe”, and the RMF is the continuously‑updated hazard ledger.

6. Kick‑starting a brand‑new prototype

gh repo create my‑fresh‑device → clone template tree.

cp QMS/Templates/PRD_template.md DHF/02_DesignInputs/PRD.md → start filling user needs & design inputs.

Create first experiments/YYYY‑MM‑DD_* folder; drop pre‑mortem + notes.

Push to develop. CI will:

render Sphinx + MkDocs preview,

run link‑check & spell‑check,

fail if YAML front‑matter incomplete.

Open a PR into main; reviewer signs off (approver: key). On merge, CI:

bumps rev field,

runs towncrier build,

tags v0.1-prototype‑A,

emits released/DHF_revA.zip.

Here is another example of things I will need in my documentation:
Use both—but for different kinds of work:

| When you’re exploring the science of your bio‑ink or process (design space, critical parameters) | → kick off the iteration with a Quality‑by‑Design (QbD) worksheet / DoE plan. |
| When you’re building or refining a product feature (electronics rev B, new slicer algorithm, firmware update) | → kick off the iteration with an updated Product Requirements Document (PRD). |

Think of QbD as a science‑first sprint and the PRD as an engineering‑build sprint.
They feed each other rather than compete.

1 | Why two kickoff artefacts?
Artefact	Primary purpose in an ISO 13485 project
QbD worksheet / DoE plan	Identify the design space and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs). Records your scientific rationale before you touch the printer. Ends with data that update risk files and design inputs.
PRD (Product Requirements Document)	Formal design inputs that the DHF will later verify/validate. Defines what the next prototype or feature must achieve.

Flow:

QbD run → learn that “shear‑thinning index 0.30–0.40” keeps cells alive.

That range becomes a requirement in the next PRD revision.

Prototype sprint is planned against the PRD; verification tests prove you hit 0.35 ± 0.02.

2 | “Sprint” vs “Prototype” in this context
Term	Meaning in your hybrid Agile / Design‑Control workflow
Sprint	Time‑boxed block of work (e.g., two weeks). Could be science‑heavy (QbD/DoE) or build‑heavy (PRD‑driven).
Prototype	The artifact produced by one or more sprints (e.g., Printhead Rev A, Bio‑ink Batch B). A single prototype may require several sprints—first to establish the design space, then to meet the PRD.

So yes—different concepts: a sprint is a temporal unit; a prototype is a deliverable.
