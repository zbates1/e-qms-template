# IoT Glucose Monitor - Premortem Analysis
**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Project**: Continuous Glucose Monitor IoT Device  
**Lead**: Greta (Testing Agent)  
**Phase**: Prototype Development & Testing

## What Could Go Wrong?

### 1. Sensor Calibration Issues
**Risk**: Glucose sensor drift causing inaccurate readings
**Impact**: Critical safety issue - false readings could lead to improper insulin dosing
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement dual-sensor redundancy
- Daily calibration requirements
- Statistical outlier detection algorithms

### 2. Wireless Connectivity Failures
**Risk**: WiFi/Bluetooth connection drops during critical measurements
**Impact**: Data loss, delayed alarms for dangerous glucose levels
**Mitigation**:
- Local data buffering (24-48 hours)
- Multiple connectivity options (WiFi + Bluetooth + cellular backup)
- Offline alarm capabilities

### 3. Battery Life Insufficient
**Risk**: Device shutting down before 14-day intended wear period
**Impact**: Treatment disruption, patient safety risk
**Mitigation**:
- Ultra-low power MCU selection
- Power management algorithms
- Battery life testing across temperature ranges

### 4. Data Security Vulnerabilities
**Risk**: HIPAA violation, patient data breach
**Impact**: Regulatory non-compliance, legal liability
**Mitigation**:
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure boot implementation
- Regular penetration testing

### 5. Manufacturing Quality Issues
**Risk**: Component variation affecting sensor accuracy
**Impact**: Device recalls, FDA enforcement actions
**Mitigation**:
- Statistical process control (SPC) implementation
- Component supplier qualification
- 100% functional testing

### 6. Regulatory Approval Delays
**Risk**: FDA 510(k) submission rejection or extended review
**Impact**: Market entry delays, funding runway issues
**Mitigation**:
- Early FDA Q-Sub meetings
- Predicate device comparison analysis
- Complete design history file documentation

## Success Metrics
- Sensor accuracy: ±15% vs reference glucose meter
- Battery life: >14 days continuous operation
- Connectivity uptime: >99.5%
- Data transmission latency: <30 seconds
- Mean time between failures: >6 months

## Pre-planned Experiments
1. **Sensor Linearity Testing**: 5-400 mg/dL glucose range
2. **Environmental Testing**: Temperature (-10°C to 50°C), humidity (10-95% RH)
3. **Biocompatibility**: ISO 10993 cytotoxicity, sensitization, irritation
4. **EMC Testing**: IEC 60601-1-2 electromagnetic compatibility
5. **Cybersecurity**: IEC 62304 software lifecycle, FDA cybersecurity guidance
